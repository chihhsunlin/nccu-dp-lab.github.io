    Research at the <strong>Privacy &amp; Security Lab</strong> focuses on the
    design and analysis of privacy-preserving and secure machine learning
    systems. Our work integrates <strong>differential privacy, neural network
    security, and data analysis</strong> to enable trustworthy AI under
    rigorous privacy and security guarantees.

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Differential Privacy Models</h3>
      <p>
        We study differential privacy across centralized, local (LDP), and
        shuffle models, with an emphasis on understanding their privacy–utility
        trade-offs and system-level implications in real-world deployments.

      <h3>Privacy Amplification &amp; Accounting</h3>
      <p>
        Our research investigates privacy amplification mechanisms, particularly
        amplification via shuffling, and develops accurate privacy accounting
        techniques based on advanced composition and Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP).

      <h3>Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        We develop differentially private data synthesis techniques for tabular,
        image, and time-series data, enabling safe data sharing while preserving
        essential statistical properties and downstream task utility.

      <h3>Neural Network Security</h3>
      <p>
        We analyze security threats in learning systems, including data
        poisoning and backdoor attacks, and design defenses to improve model
        robustness and reliability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Secure &amp; Trustworthy AI Applications</h3>
      <p>
        We apply privacy-preserving and secure machine learning techniques to
        sensitive domains such as healthcare and behavioral data analysis,
        aiming to build compliant and trustworthy AI systems.
