Our research focuses on privacy-preserving data analysis and secure machine learning.
Current research directions include:

- **Differential Privacy**  
  Local and central differential privacy mechanisms for tabular, time-series,
  and trajectory data.

- **Data Privacy**  
  Privacy-preserving data publishing and synthetic data generation.

- **Neural Network Security**  
  Robustness, privacy, and security issues in modern neural networks.
