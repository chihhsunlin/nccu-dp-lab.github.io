  <p>
    The <strong>Privacy &amp; Security Lab</strong> focuses on privacy-preserving
    and secure data analysis for modern artificial intelligence and machine
    learning systems. Our goal is to develop practical methods with
    <strong>formal privacy and security guarantees</strong> while maintaining
    high data utility.

      <h3>Differential Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        We design and analyze privacy-preserving mechanisms with rigorous
        theoretical guarantees, covering centralized, local (LDP), and shuffle
        models of differential privacy.

      <h3>Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        We study differentially private data generation techniques for tabular,
        image, and time-series data using DP-GAN, DP-VAE, and DP-SGD to enable
        safe data sharing and reuse.

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Privacy Risk and Security Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        We investigate privacy and security threats such as membership inference
        attacks, re-identification risks, and data poisoning attacks, and develop
        corresponding defense mechanisms.

      <h3>Trustworthy and Secure AI Systems</h3>
      <p>
        We explore privacy-enhancing technologies in real-world applications
        including healthcare, smart cities, and data-sharing platforms to build
        trustworthy and compliant AI systems.
