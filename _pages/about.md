The Privacy & Security Lab focuses on the study of privacy-preserving and secure data analysis for modern artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Our research aims to develop methods that achieve strong, formal privacy and security guarantees while maintaining high data utility.

Our core research areas include, but are not limited to:

Differential Privacy
We design and analyze privacy-preserving mechanisms with rigorous theoretical guarantees, covering centralized, local (LDP), and shuffle models of differential privacy.

Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis
We study differentially private data generation techniques for tabular, image, and time-series data, leveraging methods such as DP-GAN, DP-VAE, and DP-SGD to enable safe data sharing and reuse.

Privacy Risk and Security Analysis
We investigate privacy and security threats including membership inference attacks, re-identification risks, and data poisoning attacks, and develop corresponding defense mechanisms.

Trustworthy and Secure AI Systems
We explore the deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies in real-world applications such as healthcare, smart cities, and data-sharing platforms, aiming to build trustworthy and compliant AI systems.
