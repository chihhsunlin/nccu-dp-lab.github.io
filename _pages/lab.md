### NCCU Privacy & Security Lab

The Privacy & Security Lab conducts research on privacy-preserving data analysis
and secure machine learning, with a particular emphasis on differential privacy.
Our goal is to develop practical and theoretically sound methods that enable
data sharing and analysis while protecting sensitive information.

We are currently preparing to recruit graduate students.
